<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antiretroviral Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NNRTIs</li><li>NRTI</li><li>Multiclass Combination Products</li><li>Integrase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a treatment for HIV/AIDS. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are two classes of drugs that hinder the replication of the virus by targeting the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Multiclass combination products are ART drugs containing a combination of different classes, maximizing treatment effectiveness. Integrase inhibitors act on the enzyme integrase, blocking viral integration into the host DNA. These different types of ART drugs play crucial roles in suppressing the virus, reducing its replication, and managing HIV/AIDS symptoms.</p></p>
