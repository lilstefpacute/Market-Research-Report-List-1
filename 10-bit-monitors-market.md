<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 10-bit Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Native 10-bit Panel</li><li>8-bit Dithering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>10-bit monitors refer to the capability of displaying a wider range of colors compared to 8-bit monitors. Native 10-bit panels utilize a 10-bit display panel and can directly produce over a billion colors. On the other hand, 8-bit dithering monitors create the illusion of displaying more colors by rapidly switching between neighboring shades, resulting in a smoother gradient effect. While these monitors may appear similar in terms of visual quality, native 10-bit panels offer superior color accuracy and are preferred for professional tasks such as photo and video editing.</p></p>
