<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lightweight Synthetic Acrylic Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lightweight synthetic acrylic fibers market consists of two types: wet spinning and dry spinning. In wet spinning, the fibers are formed by dissolving the polymer in a chemical solution and then extruding it through spinnerets into a coagulating bath. This method is commonly used for producing acrylic fibers that possess excellent strength and dyeability. On the other hand, dry spinning involves dissolving the polymer in a solvent, which is later evaporated, leaving behind solid fibers. This process is usually employed to manufacture fibers with high resilience and softness.</p></p>
