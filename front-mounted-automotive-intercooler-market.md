<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Front Mounted Automotive Intercooler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air to Air Intercooler</li><li>Water to Air Intercooler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Front mounted automotive intercoolers are used in turbocharged and supercharged engines to cool the compressed air before it enters the engine. There are two main types: air to air intercoolers and water to air intercoolers. Air to air intercoolers use ambient air to cool down the compressed air, while water to air intercoolers use a liquid coolant system to remove heat from the compressed air. Both types help in improving engine performance and efficiency by reducing air temperature and increasing air density before combustion, resulting in more power and lower fuel consumption.</p></p>
