<p><strong>The Polyurethane Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent-borne</li><li>Reactive</li><li>Dispersion</li><li>Hot-melt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane adhesives are classified into four types: </p><p>1. Solvent-borne: These adhesives contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as solvents. They are known for their strong bonding properties and quick drying time. However, they have environmental concerns due to the release of harmful gases during application.</p><p>2. Reactive: These adhesives comprise two components that react chemically to form a strong bond. They are widely used in industries where high strength and durability are required. However, their high curing time can be a disadvantage.</p><p>3. Dispersion: These adhesives are water-based and consist of polyurethane particles dispersed in water. They are non-toxic and have low VOC content, making them environmentally friendly. They offer good flexibility and adhesion, but may have lower strength compared to other types.</p><p>4. Hot-melt: These adhesives are solid at room temperature and are heated to a molten state for application. They offer fast curing, excellent bond strength, and are commonly used in woodworking, packaging, and automotive industries. However, they may have limited heat resistance.</p></p>
