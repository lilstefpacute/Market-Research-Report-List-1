<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EV Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias Tires</li><li>Composite Tires</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>EV Tire Market Types can be broadly classified into four categories: Radial Tires, Bias Tires, Composite Tires, and Others. Radial tires are constructed with cords running radially from the center of the tire, providing greater stability and reducing rolling resistance. Bias tires have cords that crisscross diagonally, resulting in a more rigid structure and improved load-carrying capacity. Composite tires combine features of both radial and bias tires, offering a balance between durability and performance. Other types include specialized tires for specific purposes like winter tires, off-road tires, and regenerative tires.</p></p>
