<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood-thinning Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulants</li><li>Antiplatelet Drugs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Blood-thinning drugs, also known as anticoagulants, help prevent the formation of blood clots. These drugs work by inhibiting certain clotting factors in the blood, thus reducing the risk of stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, antiplatelet drugs prevent the formation of clumps in platelets, thereby preventing artery blockage and reducing the chance of heart attack or stroke. Both anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs are crucial in managing various cardiovascular conditions and are commonly prescribed by healthcare professionals to reduce the risk of blood clotting.</p></p>
