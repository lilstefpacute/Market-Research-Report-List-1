<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Coupling</li><li>Flexible Coupling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel couplings are widely used in various industries for connecting two shafts together. There are two main types of steel couplings in the market â€“ rigid coupling and flexible coupling. Rigid couplings provide a solid and fixed connection, allowing for efficient power transfer but limited tolerance for misalignment. On the other hand, flexible couplings accommodate misalignment between shafts while still transmitting torque, reducing the risk of damage. Both types play crucial roles in different applications, ensuring smooth and reliable operation of machinery and equipment.</p></p>
