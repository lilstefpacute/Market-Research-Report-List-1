<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engine Cylinder Deactivation Solenoids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Closed Solenoid valve</li><li>Normally Open Solenoid valve</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Engine Cylinder Deactivation Solenoids Market consists of two types: Normally Closed Solenoid valve and Normally Open Solenoid valve. Normally Closed Solenoid valves are closed when no power is applied and open when power is applied. These solenoids control the flow of fluid or gas by opening or closing the valves. On the other hand, Normally Open Solenoid valves are open when no power is applied and close when power is applied. These solenoids also control flow but operate in the opposite manner to Normally Closed solenoids.</p></p>
