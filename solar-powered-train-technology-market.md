<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Powered Train Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Solar Powered Train</li><li>Non-full Solar Powered Train</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar-powered train technology market consists of two main types: full solar-powered trains and non-full solar-powered trains. In the case of a full solar-powered train, the entire train's energy needs are supplied by solar power, which is generated by solar panels installed on the train itself. On the other hand, non-full solar-powered trains rely partially on solar power, using it for specific functions such as lighting, ventilation, or powering auxiliary systems, while the main propulsion still comes from other energy sources such as diesel or electricity from the grid.</p></p>
