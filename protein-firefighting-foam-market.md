<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Protein Firefighting Foam Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluoroprotein Foam</li><li>Protein Foam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Protein firefighting foam is categorized into two main types: fluoroprotein foam and protein foam. Fluoroprotein foam is a type of protein foam that is further enhanced with fluorocarbon surfactants to improve its resistance to fuel mixtures. It is particularly effective in combating fires involving flammable hydrocarbons, polar solvents, and some oxygenated compounds. On the other hand, protein foam is a foam concentrate derived from natural sources such as animal proteins. It is commonly used for suppressing fires involving non-polar flammable liquids like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuels.</p></p>
