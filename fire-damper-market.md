<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Dampers</li><li>Intumescent Dampers</li><li>Air Transfer Fire Dampers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire damper market consists of three main types: mechanical dampers, intumescent dampers, and air transfer fire dampers. Mechanical dampers are traditional devices that close off or restrict airflow during a fire. Intumescent dampers include heat-activated materials that expand when exposed to high temperatures, sealing off the ducts. Air transfer fire dampers are designed to allow airflow in normal conditions but close automatically during a fire to prevent smoke or fire spread. These different types of fire dampers cater to various fire safety requirements in buildings and industries.</p></p>
