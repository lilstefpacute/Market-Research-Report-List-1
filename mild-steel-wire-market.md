<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mild Steel Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>No Cover</li><li>Galvanized Coated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mild steel wire is available in various market types, including "No Cover" and "Galvanized Coated." In the "No Cover" market, the wire is produced without any additional protective coating, making it more affordable but also less resistant to corrosion. On the other hand, in the "Galvanized Coated" market, the wire undergoes a process of galvanization, which involves applying a protective zinc coating to enhance its corrosion resistance. This coating makes it more durable but also slightly more expensive compared to the "No Cover" variant.</p></p>
