<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Fasteners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threaded Fasteners</li><li>Non-threaded Fasteners</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive fasteners market consists of two main types: threaded fasteners and non-threaded fasteners. Threaded fasteners include bolts, screws, and nuts, which have spiral grooves or threads that enable them to securely join components together. They are commonly used in areas that require high strength and load-bearing capabilities. On the other hand, non-threaded fasteners, such as rivets, pins, and clips, do not have spiral grooves and instead rely on compression or tension to hold components together. They are often used in situations where rapid assembly and disassembly are necessary.</p></p>
