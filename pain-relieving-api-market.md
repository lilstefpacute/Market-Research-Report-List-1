<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pain-relieving API Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opiate</li><li>Non-Opiate</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pain-relieving API market can be broadly categorized into opiate and non-opiate markets. The opiate market includes APIs that work by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, providing relief from moderate to severe pain. These APIs are derived from opium or synthesized to mimic natural substances. On the other hand, the non-opiate market comprises APIs that offer pain relief through mechanisms other than opioid receptors. These APIs include analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or specific drugs targeting pain pathways, without the risk of dependence or addiction associated with opiates.</p></p>
