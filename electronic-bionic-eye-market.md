<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Bionic Eye Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Eye</li><li>Implanted Eye</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electronic bionic eye market encompasses two main types: the external eye and the implanted eye. The external eye refers to a device that is worn on the user's face and captures external images, which are then transmitted to an electrode array implanted inside the eye. This array stimulates the retinal cells, enabling vision to the user. On the other hand, the implanted eye involves a surgical procedure to implant an artificial eye directly onto the retina, which functions in a similar way to the external eye. The market for both types aims to restore vision to individuals with visual impairments.</p></p>
