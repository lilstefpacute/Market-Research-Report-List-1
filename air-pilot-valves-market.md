<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Pilot Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single</li><li>Double</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Air pilot valves are used in various industries to control the flow of air or other gases. They are available in two main types: single market and double market valves. </p><p>Single market valves have one chamber connected to the air supply and another connected to the actuator. When the pilot pressure is applied, the valve switches from one position to another. </p><p>On the other hand, double market valves have two chambers that allow for more complex control. They enable independent control of both the air supply and the actuator, providing greater flexibility in valve positioning and flow regulation.</p></p>
