<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Layer Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresists</li><li>Negative Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Thick Layer Photoresists market offers two main types: Positive Photoresists and Negative Photoresists. Positive Photoresists are designed to become more soluble when exposed to light, creating a positive image of the desired pattern. They are commonly used in semiconductor and microelectronics industries. On the other hand, Negative Photoresists become less soluble when exposed to light, resulting in a negative image. They find applications in printed circuit board manufacturing and other areas where high-resolution patterns are required. Both types play crucial roles in the production of electronic components and contribute to the advancement of technology.</p></p>
