<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas Engine Oils Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ashless Gas Engine Oil</li><li>Low Ash Gas Engine Oil</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The natural gas engine oils market consists of two primary types: ashless gas engine oil and low ash gas engine oil. Ashless gas engine oil is formulated without any metallic-based additives that can leave behind ash deposits when burned. This type of oil is ideal for high-performance engines that require clean and efficient combustion. On the other hand, low ash gas engine oil contains a small amount of metallic additives, which helps reduce wear and friction in the engine while minimizing harmful ash deposits. Both types of oils are formulated to cater to the specific needs of natural gas engines.</p></p>
