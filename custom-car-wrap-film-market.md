<p><strong>The Custom Car Wrap Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Film</li><li>Calendered Film</li></ul></p>

It is more flexible, durable, and conformable, making it perfect for complex curves and contours of the vehicle. On the other hand, calendered film is created through a manufacturing process that uses a series of rollers to press the vinyl into the desired thickness. It is less expensive but less conformable and not as long-lasting as cast film.</p></p>
