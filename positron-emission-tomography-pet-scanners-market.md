<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positron Emission Tomography PET Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full-Ring Pet Scanner</li><li>Partial-Ring Pet Scanner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners are medical imaging devices that use radioactive tracers to detect diseases and abnormalities in the body. There are two main types of PET scanners: Full-Ring and Partial-Ring Pet Scanners. Full-Ring PET scanners have a complete ring detector surrounding the patient, providing more accurate and detailed imaging. Partial-Ring PET scanners, on the other hand, have a smaller ring detector, resulting in lower resolution images. Both types have their uses, with Full-Ring PET scanners generally preferred for complex diagnoses and Partial-Ring PET scanners offering cost-effective solutions for routine imaging.</p></p>
