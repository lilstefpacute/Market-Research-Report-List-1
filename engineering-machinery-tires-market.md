<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engineering Machinery Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Engineering machinery tires can be categorized into two types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires are constructed with multiple layers of fabric cords that crisscross at different angles, providing strength and flexibility. They are suitable for rough terrains and offer excellent stability. On the other hand, radial tires have layers that run radially from the bead to the tread, giving them improved traction and reduced rolling resistance. They are suitable for high-speed operations and offer better fuel efficiency. The choice between bias and radial tires largely depends on the application and specific requirements of the machinery.</p></p>
