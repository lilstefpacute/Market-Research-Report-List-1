<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Anesthesia Video Laryngoscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li><li>Un-Channelled Video Laryngoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disposable anesthesia video laryngoscopes can be divided into two types: channelled and un-channelled video laryngoscopes. Channelled video laryngoscopes have a built-in channel or pathway that allows the insertion of an endotracheal tube or other airway devices, facilitating the intubation process. On the other hand, un-channelled video laryngoscopes do not have this channel, requiring a separate technique or device for intubation. Both types offer the advantage of being disposable, eliminating the risk of cross-contamination and reducing the need for time-consuming cleaning and sterilization processes.</p></p>
