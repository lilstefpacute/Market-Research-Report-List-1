<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cell Culture Protein Surface Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-coating</li><li>Pre-coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the cell culture protein surface coatings market, there are two main types: self-coating and pre-coating. Self-coating refers to a method where the protein coating is applied directly to the culture surface by the user. This allows for greater flexibility and customization, but it requires more time and effort. On the other hand, pre-coating involves purchasing culture surfaces that have already been coated with protein, saving users time and effort. However, pre-coating may have limited options for customization compared to self-coating.</p></p>
