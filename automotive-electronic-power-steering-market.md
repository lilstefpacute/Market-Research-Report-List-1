<p><p>Automotive Electronic Power Steering (EPS) is an advanced technology used in automobiles to assist the driver in steering the vehicle. It provides easy maneuverability and improves overall vehicle stability. EPS systems use electronic control units (ECUs) and sensors to calculate driver input and determine the necessary amount of power assistance required. This information is then transmitted to an electric motor that assists in turning the steering wheel.</p><p>The Automotive Electronic Power Steering Market is growing rapidly due to several factors. Firstly, increasing concerns about fuel efficiency and emission regulations have led to the development of lightweight and energy-efficient EPS systems. These systems reduce the energy consumption of the vehicle and improve fuel economy. Secondly, the rising demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles has driven the adoption of EPS systems, as they can be easily integrated with electric powertrains. Additionally, the growing trend of vehicle electrification and the incorporation of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are fueling the demand for EPS systems.</p><p>In terms of market analysis, the Automotive Electronic Power Steering Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.8% during the forecast period. The market is highly competitive with several key players dominating the industry. Major automotive manufacturers are increasingly focusing on developing EPS systems and integrating them into their vehicle models to enhance driving experience and meet regulatory requirements. Furthermore, advancements in EPS technology, such as the development of steer-by-wire systems and electric double pinion systems, are likely to further drive the market growth.</p><p>In conclusion, the Automotive Electronic Power Steering Market is experiencing significant growth and is expected to continue its upward trajectory in the coming years. Factors like fuel efficiency concerns, increasing demand for electric vehicles, and vehicle electrification are driving the market. Advancements in EPS technology and the rise of ADAS systems are also contributing to market growth.</p></p>
