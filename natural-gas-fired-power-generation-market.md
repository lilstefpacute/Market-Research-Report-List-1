<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas-Fired Power Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCGT</li><li>OCGT</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Natural gas-fired power generation is classified into two main types: combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) and open cycle gas turbine (OCGT). CCGT power plants are more efficient, with a gas turbine generating electricity and excess heat being utilized by a steam turbine. This enables higher overall efficiency and lower emissions. OCGT power plants, on the other hand, only use a gas turbine for electricity generation, resulting in lower efficiency. Both market types play a crucial role in meeting electricity demand, but CCGT is preferred due to its higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.</p></p>
