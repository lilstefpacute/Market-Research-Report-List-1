<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corn-Based Ethanol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Milling Process Ethanol</li><li>Dry Milling Process Ethanol</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Corn-based ethanol is produced through two different processes: wet milling and dry milling. Wet milling involves separating corn into its component parts, such as protein, fiber, and starch, and then fermenting the starch into ethanol. This process produces co-products like corn gluten feed and corn gluten meal. On the other hand, dry milling involves grinding the whole corn kernel into a powder, fermenting the starch into ethanol, and producing co-products like dried distillers grains with solubles. Both processes have their own unique market types and co-product outputs in the corn-based ethanol industry.</p></p>
