<p><strong>The Anti-redeposition Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Particles</li><li>Powder</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Anti-redeposition agents are substances used in detergents to prevent dirt and soil from redepositing onto fabrics during the washing process. There are three main types of anti-redeposition agents, namely particles, powder, and liquid. Particle-based agents are solid materials with large particle sizes that effectively bind to the dirt particles. Powder agents are fine particles that easily dissolve in water, forming a solution that prevents redeposition. Liquid agents are in a liquid form and are typically added directly to the laundry. Each type has its own benefits and applications in the market.</p></p>
