<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Elastomers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Elastomers</li><li>Thermosetting Elastomers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyurethane elastomers are a type of material used in various industries for their excellent mechanical properties. There are two main types of polyurethane elastomers: thermoplastic elastomers and thermosetting elastomers. Thermoplastic elastomers can be melted and reformed multiple times without losing their properties, making them highly versatile and recyclable. On the other hand, thermosetting elastomers undergo a permanent chemical change when heated, resulting in a rigid and durable material that cannot be melted and reshaped. Both types have unique advantages and find applications in a wide range of industries.</p></p>
