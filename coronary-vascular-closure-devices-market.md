<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coronary Vascular Closure Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Coronary VCDs</li><li>Non-Invasive Coronary VCDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coronary Vascular Closure Devices (VCDs) refer to medical devices used to close the puncture site in the artery after an invasive cardiac catheterization procedure. There are two types of Coronary VCDs available in the market: Invasive and Non-Invasive. Invasive Coronary VCDs require a small incision to be made in the artery, allowing the device to be inserted and securely fastened to close the wound. Non-Invasive Coronary VCDs, on the other hand, utilize external pressure or sealant materials to close the puncture site without any incision.</p></p>
