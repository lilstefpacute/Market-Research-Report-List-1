<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Gas Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Potentiometric Oxygen Sensors</li><li>Amperometric Oxygen Sensors</li><li>Resistive Oxygen Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oxygen gas sensors are devices used to measure the concentration of oxygen in various environments. There are three main types of oxygen gas sensors: potentiometric, amperometric, and resistive. Potentiometric oxygen sensors work by measuring the voltage generated between two electrodes in response to changes in oxygen concentration. Amperometric sensors measure the current flow between two electrodes, which varies depending on the oxygen concentration. Resistive sensors, on the other hand, measure the change in electrical resistance caused by the presence of oxygen. These sensors find applications in industries such as healthcare, automotive, and aerospace for monitoring oxygen levels.</p></p>
