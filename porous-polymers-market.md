<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Porous Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crystalline State</li><li>Amorphous State</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Porous Polymers market can be classified into two types based on the structural characteristics of the polymers - Crystalline State and Amorphous State. In the Crystalline State, the polymer chains are arranged in a highly ordered and repeating pattern, resulting in a rigid and well-defined structure with uniform pore sizes. On the other hand, in the Amorphous State, the polymer chains lack a regular arrangement, leading to a more flexible and disordered structure with varying pore sizes. These different states offer distinct properties and applications in industries such as gas storage, catalysis, and separations.</p></p>
