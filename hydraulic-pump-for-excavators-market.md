<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Pump for Excavators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gear Pump</li><li>Piston Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The hydraulic pump market for excavators can be classified into two main types: gear pump and piston pump. Gear pumps are commonly used in smaller excavators due to their simple design and lower cost. They have a constant displacement and operate at a fixed speed. On the other hand, piston pumps are preferred in larger excavators as they provide higher efficiency and better control over flow and pressure. They have a variable displacement and can operate at different speeds based on the requirements of the excavator.</p></p>
