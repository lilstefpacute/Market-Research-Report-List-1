<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Recycled (Retreaded) Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre Cure</li><li>Mold Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The recycled (retreaded) tires market consists of two main types: precure and mold cure. In the precure process, a new tread rubber is applied to a prepared tire casing using an adhesive and is then cured in a chamber. This method offers better fuel efficiency and longer tread life. On the other hand, the mold cure method involves applying a new tread rubber to a prepared tire casing that has been preheated. The casing is then placed in a mold and heated, resulting in a bonded tread. Both methods provide cost-effective alternatives to new tires, reducing waste and promoting sustainability in the automotive industry.</p></p>
